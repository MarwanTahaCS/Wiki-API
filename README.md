# Wiki-API
This is a RESTful API code, build using node.js and REST functions, simple but functional.

I have published this API, so if you are curious to run it, u can clone it to your own machine
- make sure you have node.js installed
- make sure to run "npm install"
- add a file called secret.txt, and copy+past in it's first line your functional mongoDB URL.
- run it by typing the command "node app.js"

note: this code only listens to request via port: "localhost:3000/", you can easily modify it
      to listen to other ports by adding to the listening-to-port function your port's url.
